The application lets the user add or edit project information. When adding or editing a project, the application prompts the user for title, date, skills, description, and a link to a repo. The results for these entries are stored in a database and displayed on the homepage. The HTML/CSS for this site has been supplied for you.

Install the requirements with 'pip install -r requirements.txt' 
Run the app.py file  with 'python app.py' 
Copy the server address from the console and paste it on a browser to view the website


### What I Learned
In the process of creating this portfolio, I learned how to work with Flask to build a web application and handle routes and requests. And how CRUD operations work in a web application.
This project helped me to understand how the internet is designed and appreciate the usability of websites. It also helped me gain new knowledge in web development and database management. I'm excited to continue learning and building on this foundation in future projects.
