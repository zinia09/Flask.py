# Portfolio Web Application

### Functionality
This is an interface for a portfolio web application that allows users to add, edit, and display project information. 
The main (index) page lists all the projects in the database, including the project title and short description. 
Each project links to a detail page that displays the title, date, and description of the project.
The application allows users to add or edit project information. 
When adding or editing a project, the user is prompted for the project title, date, skills, description, and a link to a repository. 
The entered data is stored in a database and displayed on the homepage.


### Technologies Used
HTML
CSS
Flask
SQLite

### How to Use
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the necessary dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the application with python app.py.
Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000 to view the homepage.
From the homepage, you can view all projects, click on a project to view its details, and add or edit projects.

### What I Learned
In the process of creating this portfolio web application, I learned several new skills and technologies, including:

HTML/CSS: I improved my skills in building responsive web pages and learned new techniques for styling elements using CSS.
Flask: I learned how to use the Flask framework to build a web application and handle routes and requests.
SQL and SQLAlchemy: I gained experience in working with databases and using SQLAlchemy to interact with a SQLite database.
CRUD operations: I learned how to implement basic CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations in a web application.
Git and version control: I learned how to use Git to track changes to my code and collaborate with others using version control.
Overall, this project helped me to build upon my existing skills and gain new knowledge in web development and database management. I'm excited to continue learning and building on this foundation in future projects.
